further bursts of heavy rain are expected in the auckland subnational between now and sunday. forecasts will be reviewed throughout the day.
localised downpours are possible anywhere in the subnational from friday afternoon and throughout weekend, with highest risk times expected to be friday night and into saturday morning.
downpours can cause flash flooding, land slips, and make driving hazardous.

metservice tells us that weather coming through tonight and tomorrow morning could be as bad, or worse, than that which caused flooding earlier in the week. with such volatile weather patterns, we cannot pinpoint the areas that will be most affected.

this makes it very important for all aucklanders to keep an eye on weather updates and make sensible decisions this weekend

preparedness
•	check drains and gutters to ensure these aren’t blocked.
•	take extreme care if you are driving in heavy rain, and delay trips if possible.
•	do not drive through floodwaters.
•	consider alternative plans if you have an outdoor event scheduled this weekend.
•	if you live on a rural property, think about livestock rotation for the weekend, especially if areas of your farms are flood-prone.
•	keep an eye on the weather forecast.
•	if life or property is at risk, call 111.
•	if you experience stormwater issues or trees down on public land, call auckland council on (09) 301 0101.

extreme rainfall today (wednesday) and tomorrow will hit great barrier island prior to the arrival of tropical cyclone cook.
barrier residents are urged to prepare for bursts of heavy rain and localised deluges over the next two days. this will be followed by the arrival of tc cook on thursday which is expected to bring more intense rain and extremely high winds of up to 165-plus kmph.
current forecasts show the cyclone arriving around midday thursday however keep an eye on updated forecasts throughout the day as this may change.

179,96,0,NZL,en,general notifications,urgent advice 12 april 2017 | kawakawa bay residents,"[auckland cdem] morning residents of kawakawa bay,
extreme rainfall today (wednesday) and tomorrow will hit the auckland subnational and is likely to significantly impact kawakawa bay prior to the arrival of tropical cyclone cook.

advice for kawakawa bay residents and orere point residents:
a significant storm event, followed by the arrival of tropical cyclone cook, is highly likely to bring extreme weather – with significant rainfall and high winds – to the south eastern part of the auckland subnational.
communities in the kawakawa bay and orere point area, particularly those towards the waiti bay end of kawakawa bay coast road, are expected to again be isolated by road and without power or phone for a substantial amount of time.
waiti bay residents only – consider alternative accommodation.
auckland civil defence strongly recommends that residents in the waiti bay area look at alternative accommodation for the next few days and potentially for longer.
should you choose to stay, you may be isolated for some time while power, phone and access is restored. make sure you are prepared.
general advice
•	never attempt to drive over slips and treat power lines as live at all times.
•	if there is an immediate risk to life or property contact the emergency services on 111.
•	check on neighbours and family, especially if they are in at risk areas or might be affected by flooding or slips.
•	move away from flooded areas and stay out of floodwaters.
•	never try to walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters.
•	if you get stuck in a flood, get out of your car and move to higher ground immediately, taking great care in the floodwaters.
•	if driving at night, drive slowly, especially through flood-prone areas as you may encounter flooding at short notice.

insurance: once the storm is over or it is safe to return home, contact your insurance company. if possible, take photos of damage.
take good care of yourself: recovering from a major storm is a big job. it is tough on both your body and your spirit. learn how to recognise and care for anxiety, stress and fatigue.
if you can’t live in your house due to flooding, slips, lack of access or extreme damage to you, try and stay with family or friends. if you can’t, auckland council may be able to assist, contact us on 0800 22 22 00 for further support.

please take care of yourselves and keep an eye on your community.
